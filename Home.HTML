            <p>The amount of water a tree needs depends on many factors, including the age and species of the tree, the time of year, weather and soil type. As a rule, newly planted and young trees require more frequent watering than older, well-established trees. But during extended periods of drought, all trees benefit from supplemental watering.</p>

               <p>Overhead sprinklers are the easiest way to cover large expanses, but they're inefficient, losing up to half the water to evaporation. Trees are better served by watering methods that apply water slowly, right at soil level. It may take several hours to properly water a single mature tree.</p>

         <p>According to Phoenix-based author Cathy Cromell, in desert conditions irrigation should soak the soil at least 3' deep. "We have such salty water and salty soil; deep watering helps by leaching salts past the root zone. Salt burn is a very common here</p>
